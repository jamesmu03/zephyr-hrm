    "  * Remember that single data points for any single input voltage pair is not adequate; multiple measurements should be made and error bars presented on all plots.\n",

    "* Compare your calculated RMS value to the expected RMS value of the sinusoidal signal.  Discuss any differences between your calculated RMS value and the expected RMS value.\n"
